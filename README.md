%% MEG DATA preprocessing and PSD eatimation:
Resting state MEG data were preprocessed and used for PSD estimations, following the methods described previously.
The codes used for preprocessing and PSD estimations can be found here: 
%% Calculating aperiodic slope:
The codes used for aperiodic slope analysis are include un this repository
%% PLS analysis:
The PLS analyses used in this paper was initially described by Krishnan et. al (Krishnan, A., Williams, L.J., McIntosh, A.R., & Abdi, H. (2011). Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods for neuroimaging: A tutorial and review. NeuroImage, 56, 455-475). The codes used are found here: https://personal.utdallas.edu/~herve/KWMA_2011_Example_Scripts.zip
